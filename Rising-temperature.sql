-- https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/

Table: Weather

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.

Write a solution to find all dates id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday)
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+

-- Schema: 

CREATE TABLE Weather (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    recordDate DATE,
    temperature INT
);

INSERT INTO Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) VALUES
(1, '2015-01-01', 10),
(2, '2015-01-02', 25),
(3, '2015-01-03', 20),
(4, '2015-01-04', 30);

-- Solution:

WITH weather_cte AS (
    SELECT
id, temperature AS t1,
lag(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS t2
from weather
)

SELECT id
FROM weather_cte
where t1 > t2;
