-- https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-earning-more-than-their-managers/

Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.
 

Write a solution to find the employees who earn more than their managers.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Output: 
+----------+

-- Schema:

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    salary INT,
    managerId INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (managerId) REFERENCES Employee(id)
);

INSERT INTO Employee (id, name, salary, managerId) VALUES
(1, 'Joe', 70000, 3),
(2, 'Henry', 80000, 4),
(3, 'Sam', 60000, NULL),
(4, 'Max', 90000, NULL);

-- Solution:

SELECT e.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e
JOIN Employee m
  ON e.managerId = m.id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary;
